My professional resume site built with **Next.js** and automatically deployed to **Google Cloud Run**.

## üöÄ CI/CD at a Glance

  D-->E[Deploy to Cloud Run];
  E-->F[resume.mindtunnel.org];
```

The pipeline runs on every push to `main` and on manual dispatches. GitHub Actions handles testing, building the Docker image, pushing it to Google Container Registry, and deploying to Cloud Run.

On the homepage, a compact diagram illustrates this flow so visitors can quickly see how a commit becomes the running site.
