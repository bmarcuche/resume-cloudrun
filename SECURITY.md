# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

This document outlines the security measures, policies, and procedures for the resume.mindtunnel.org application.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Application Security

#### 1. Security Headers
The application implements comprehensive security headers:

- **X-Frame-Options**: `DENY` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: `nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-XSS-Protection**: `1; mode=block` - Enables XSS filtering
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` - Enforces HTTPS
- **Referrer-Policy**: `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information

#### 2. HTTPS Enforcement
- All traffic is encrypted using TLS 1.2+
- HTTP requests are automatically redirected to HTTPS
- SSL certificates are automatically managed by Google Cloud

#### 3. Content Security Policy
Implemented through Next.js configuration to prevent:
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
- Data injection attacks
- Clickjacking attempts

### Infrastructure Security

#### 1. Container Security
- **Non-root execution**: Application runs as non-privileged user
- **Minimal base image**: Alpine Linux for reduced attack surface
- **No secrets in images**: All sensitive data via environment variables
- **Regular updates**: Automated dependency and base image updates

#### 2. Cloud Run Security
- **Private container registry**: Images stored in Google Container Registry
- **IAM-based access control**: Principle of least privilege
- **VPC integration**: Network isolation when needed
- **Audit logging**: All access and changes logged

#### 3. CI/CD Security
- **Secret management**: GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- **Service account isolation**: Dedicated SA with minimal permissions
- **Signed commits**: Verification of code integrity
- **Dependency scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection

## üîç Security Scanning

### Automated Scans

1. **Dependency Scanning**:
   - `npm audit` for known vulnerabilities
   - Snyk integration for comprehensive analysis
   - Automated security updates via Dependabot

2. **Container Scanning**:
   - Base image vulnerability assessment
   - Runtime security monitoring
   - Regular security patches

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - Static code analysis for security issues
   - ESLint security rules
   - TypeScript strict mode for type safety

### Manual Security Reviews

- Quarterly security audits
- Penetration testing (as needed)
- Code review for security implications
- Infrastructure security assessment

## üö® Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification

#### High Severity
- Data breach or unauthorized access
- Service compromise
- Critical vulnerability exploitation

#### Medium Severity
- Suspicious activity detection
- Non-critical vulnerability discovery
- Performance degradation due to attacks

#### Low Severity
- Security configuration drift
- Minor vulnerability discovery
- Security policy violations

### Response Procedures

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and manual reporting
2. **Assessment**: Severity classification and impact analysis
3. **Containment**: Immediate threat mitigation
4. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis
5. **Recovery**: Service restoration and hardening
6. **Documentation**: Incident report and lessons learned

### Contact Information

For security incidents or vulnerabilities:
- **Email**: security@mindtunnel.org

- `SNYK_TOKEN`: Security scanning token
- Regular secret rotation schedule

#### Environment Variables
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- Runtime configuration via environment
- Secure secret injection in containers
- Audit trail for configuration changes

## üìã Compliance

### Standards Adherence

- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common vulnerabilities
